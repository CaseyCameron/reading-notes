# HTML Chapter 1: "Structure"
### HTML pages are simply text documents that use tags or elements that can be assigned attributes. Attributes require a name and a value. 

# HTML Chapter 8: "Extra Markup"
### Browers need DOCTYPES to know which version of HTML is used. ids and class attributes allow us to identify HTML elements (and use them in JS). <div> and <span> group block-level and inline elements. 


# HTML Chapter 17: "HTML 5 Layout"
### Div used to be the boss for page layouts. Now it's new elements that reflect the content contained within.
### Navigation tabs usually listed out <ul><li>etc...</li></ul>
### <article> often contains <figure> that have images with <figcaption> and <hgroup> (header groups) that contain headings <h1> through <h6>. <hgroup> met with mixed reception. Originally removed, but now it's back. <figcaption> typically contain media klike images, videos, graphs, diagrams, code samples. Should always contain a <figcaption> containing a text description of the media content
### Older browsers don't support HTML5

# HTML Chapter 18: "Process and Design"
### Know your target audience and build it for them, not you
### Ask why they visit your site. Key motivations and their specific goals. What key info do they need
### Plan out a site map and wireframe your pages
### Design communicates to the user. Visual heirarchy helps users understand the info you've got
### Use size, color, and style to segment and organize info


# JS Chapter 1: "ABC of Programming"
### Writing a script - Start with the big picture and break it down
1) Define the goal
2) design the script, splitting the goal into tasks, commenting them in
3) code each step
4) think like a QA engineer like you used to do

### Objects are things that can have properties, events, and methods which together create a working model of that object. 
### Properties are the characteristics of the model
### Event is something that happens via the code
### Method is code that has instructions. You don't always need to know how it achieves its task, just the answer it gives you
### Long story short, Computers use data to create models of things in the real world. 
### Web browsers have a window object and a document object, and the doc obj reps an html page
### A browser receives html code, creates a mdoel of the pages & stores to memory, then renders it on the screen via an engine (like css)
### HTML is the content layer, CSS is the presentation layer, JS is the behavior layer
